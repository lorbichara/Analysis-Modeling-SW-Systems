# Analysis-Modeling-SW-Systems
Assigments created for the Analysis and Modeling of Software Systems course, using Java.

This repository was created to upload assignments made for the Analysis and Modeling of Software Systems couse, where we learn about object-oriented models, techniques and tools for analizing, designing and implementing computer systems.
Java is used to code simple exercises that were previously modeled.
